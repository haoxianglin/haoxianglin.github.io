I hold a Ph.D in astronomy from the University of Tokyo (東京大学) and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Peking University (北京大学), focusing on theoretical astrophysics to study high-energy phenomena in the universe.
My research experience involves extensive data science, with 8 years of experience in Python-based scientific research, 
including data analysis and visualization, using libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
I have collaborated with a satellite observational team (GECAM) from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院) as well as 
a numerical simulation team from the Kyoto University (京都大学) to analyze astronomical data and build mathematical models. 
Additionally, I have developed a statistical approach to predict the detection probability of cosmological events with future astronomical projects.
