I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (KIAA), Peking University, working on theoretical astrophysics towards understanding high-energy phenomena in the Universe.
Much of my work is on gamma-ray bursts. 
I analyze data from some distinguished gamma-ray bursts (GRB 170817A, associated with gravitational waves from a neutron star merger; GRB 221009A, the brightest GRB ever recorded) to understand the nature of such sources. Also, I predict the detectability of future events and derive information reconstruction from the observables.
