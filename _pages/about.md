I hold a bachelor degree from Nanjing University (南京大学) and a Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of Tokyo (東京大学), and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Peking University (北京大学), focusing on theoretical astrophysics to study high-energy phenomena in the universe.

Over the years, I’ve worked on exciting projects, including collaborations with a satellite team (GECAM) from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院) on the brighest-of-all-time gamma-ray burst ever recorded (GRB 221009A) and with a numerical relativity group from Kyoto University (京都大学) on the first-ever observation of a multi-messenger event --- binary neutron star merger (GW170817/GRB 170817A). 
I’ve also developed a Bayesian framework to predict the detection probability of multi-messenger events, optimizing observation strategies for international science projects (e.g. CHIME, CTA).

Now, I’m transitioning to the industry, focusing on data science and quantitative finance, where I can apply my analytical skills in new and impactful ways.

In my spare time, I love diving into challenging hardcore video games like those from FromSoftware, and I enjoy card games such as Hearthstone and Yu-Gi-Oh.
