Binary Neutron Star Merger

GW170817, observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors on August 17, 2017, was a gravitational wave signal produced by the final inspiral and merger of a binary neutron star system. 
We performed Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) modeling of the observed afterglow emission from shock-accelerated electrons powered by the relativistic outflow of this merger (Lin+19, MNRAS, 485, 2155). 
Our analysis, assuming a natural fraction (<100%) of accelerated electrons rather than the commonly assumed 100%, reveals an observable spectral break in the early radio band. This observable break, found through MCMC fitting, contrasts with the no-break solutions reported in other studies.
This new solution suggests a small particle acceleration efficiency and near electron-ion equipartition in relativistic shocks, consistent with previous results from particle-in-cell numerical simulations.
Future low-frequency early radio observations are strongly encouraged to capture this crucial information.
