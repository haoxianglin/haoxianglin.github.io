The Brightest-Of-All-Time Gamma-Ray Burst
======
I have contributed to the data analysis, visualization, and modeling of the brightest-of-all-time (BOAT) gamma-ray busrt ever recorded (GRB 221009A), in collaboration with a satellite team ([GECAM (Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor)](https://gecam.ihep.ac.cn)) from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

This project led to two papers published in the main astronomy journal letters (ApJ Letters):

[Relation between prompt and afterglow emission](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad6df8)

[Interpretation about line emission](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad758e)

*Continuous energy injection*: modeling the observed correlation between cumulative prompt luminosity and afterglow luminosity with a time delay:

*High latitude effect*: modeling the observation of a series emission lines with a time evolution index of -1:

Bayesian Multi-messenger Astronomy
======
Multi-messenger astronomy is the coordinated observation and interpretation of multiple signals (e.g. gravitational waves, electromagnetic waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays) received from the same astrophysical event (e.g. binary neutron star merger). 

In my Ph.D. thesis, I develop a Bayesian framework to predict detection probability of multi-messenger events based on prior knowledge about sources and detectors, and to optimize observational strategy of one messenger upon observation of another.
This research is applied to testing hypotheses regarding the origin of astronomical events and predicting detectability for future international science projects, such as the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).

This project led to two papers published in the main astronomy journals (MNRAS, ApJ).

Binary Neutron Star Merger
======
I have collaborated with the numerical relativity group at the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics on modeling the first observational data of a multi-messenger event --- binary neutron star merger (GW170817/GRB 170817A). 

This project led to one paper published in the main astronomy journal (MNRAS).

<!-- GW170817, observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors on August 17, 2017, was a gravitational wave signal produced by the final inspiral and merger of a binary neutron star system. The afterglow of this merger was seen across the electromagnetic spectrum by 70 observatories on 7 continents and in space, marking a significant breakthrough for multi-messenger astronomy.

We performed Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) modeling of the observed afterglow emission from shock-accelerated electrons powered by the relativistic outflow of this merger ([Lin+2019, MNRAS, 485, 2155](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/2/2155/5319137)). 
Our analysis, assuming a natural fraction (<100%) of accelerated electrons rather than the commonly assumed 100%, reveals an observable spectral break in the early radio band. This observable break contrasts with the no-break solutions reported in other studies.
This new solution suggests a small particle acceleration efficiency and near electron-ion equipartition in relativistic shocks, consistent with previous results from particle-in-cell numerical simulations.

Future low-frequency early radio observations are strongly encouraged to capture this crucial information. -->
