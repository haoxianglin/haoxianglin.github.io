The BOAT GRB
======
I have contributed to the data analysis, visualization, and modeling of the brightest-of-all-time (BOAT) gamma-ray busrt ever recorded (GRB 221009A), in collaboration with a satellite team ([GECAM (Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor)](https://gecam.ihep.ac.cn)) from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I led as corresponding author of two papers published in the main astronomy journal letters (ApJ Letters):

Bayesian Multi-messenger Astronomy
======
Multi-messenger astronomy is the coordinated observation and interpretation of multiple signals received from the same astrophysical event. 
Such events involve a variety of astrophysical processes, each of which may independently emit signals of a characteristic "messenger" type: gravitational waves, electromagnetic waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays. 
Recognizing that these diverse signals originate from the same source allows for a joint reconstruction of information about the event, providing optimization for observational strategies.

In my Ph.D. thesis, I formulate a Bayesian approach to calculate joint detection rate of multi-messenger events and derive joint posterior constraint on intrinsic parameters.
This formulation has been applied to several studies: 
- Testing neutron star mergers as a possible origin of fast radio bursts. ([Lin+2020, MNRAS, 498, 2384](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/498/2/2384/5900531))
- Estimating the possibilities of observing radio afterglows from neutron star mergers with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment. ([Shikauchi+2022, ApJ, 928, 1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac540d))
- Predicting the chances of detecting very-high-energy counterparts of gravitational waves from neutron star mergers with the Cherenkov Telescope Array. (Lin+, in prep.)

Binary Neutron Star Merger
======
GW170817, observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors on August 17, 2017, was a gravitational wave signal produced by the final inspiral and merger of a binary neutron star system. The afterglow of this merger was seen across the electromagnetic spectrum by 70 observatories on 7 continents and in space, marking a significant breakthrough for multi-messenger astronomy.

We performed Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) modeling of the observed afterglow emission from shock-accelerated electrons powered by the relativistic outflow of this merger ([Lin+2019, MNRAS, 485, 2155](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/2/2155/5319137)). 
Our analysis, assuming a natural fraction (<100%) of accelerated electrons rather than the commonly assumed 100%, reveals an observable spectral break in the early radio band. This observable break contrasts with the no-break solutions reported in other studies.
This new solution suggests a small particle acceleration efficiency and near electron-ion equipartition in relativistic shocks, consistent with previous results from particle-in-cell numerical simulations.
<!-- Future low-frequency early radio observations are strongly encouraged to capture this crucial information. -->
