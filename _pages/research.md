The Brightest-of-all-time (BOAT) GRB

Multi-messenger Astronomy
======
Multi-messenger astronomy is the coordinated observation and interpretation of multiple signals received from the same astrophysical event. 
Such events involve a variety of astrophysical processes, each of which may independently emit signals of a characteristic "messenger" type: gravitational waves, electromagnetic waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays. 
Recognizing that these diverse signals originate from the same source allows for a joint reconstruction of information about the event, providing deeper insights into the nature of the source.
In my Ph.D. thesis, I formulate a Bayesian approach to calculate joint detection rate of multi-messenger events and derive joint posterior constraint on intrinsic parameters.
This formulation has been applied to several studies: 
testing neutron star mergers as a possible origin of fast radio bursts [Lin+2020, MNRAS, 498, 2384](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/498/2/2384/5900531); 
Estimating the possibilities of observing radio afterglows from neutron star mergers with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment [Shikauchi+2022, ApJ, 928, 1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac540d); 
Predicting the chances of detecting very-high-energy counterparts of gravitational waves from neutron star mergers with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (Lin+, in prep.).

Binary Neutron Star Mergers
======
GW170817, observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors on August 17, 2017, was a gravitational wave signal produced by the final inspiral and merger of a binary neutron star system. 
We performed Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) modeling of the observed afterglow emission from shock-accelerated electrons powered by the relativistic outflow of this merger [Lin+2019, MNRAS, 485, 2155](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/2/2155/5319137). 
Our analysis, assuming a natural fraction (<100%) of accelerated electrons rather than the commonly assumed 100%, reveals an observable spectral break in the early radio band. This observable break, found through MCMC fitting, contrasts with the no-break solutions reported in other studies.
This new solution suggests a small particle acceleration efficiency and near electron-ion equipartition in relativistic shocks, consistent with previous results from particle-in-cell numerical simulations.
Future low-frequency early radio observations are strongly encouraged to capture this crucial information.
